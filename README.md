# Climate-Risk-Dashboard
Climate Risk Dashboard by making use of IMF Published data on climate movement and macro economic factors Using PowerBI 


I prepared 4 dashboards using IMF published data on climate change.

1. Climate risk is a big deal and well discussed topic these days. Banks and financial institutes are finding various means in order to incorporate the climate risk under their risk models in order maintain the buffer capital. The objective of this project was to understand the overall change in the climate scenario in terms of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and the average surface temperature rise. apart from that I have also incorporated macro components of Green financing  in these PowerBI Dashboards. 

2. Data was extracted from the IMF source websites. PowerBI was used as a tool for related data processing like pivoting, changing date formats and so on and and also for all the subsequent visualizations. 

3. The end deliverable through the 4 dashboards using advanced visualization techniques in PowerBI displays the climate scenario movements over the years across the different countries. This app also helps us set a context on how the climate changes are impacting the global macro economic environments to a great extent. 

The power Bi app file is attached herewith for easy reference.
